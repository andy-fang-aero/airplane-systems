/**
 * Declarative catalogue of every modelled SR22T component, one file per system group.
 * Geometry is built lazily (browser only). Positions are in airplane coordinates unless the
 * part has a `parent`, in which case they are relative to that moving group.
 * - catalogue.ts — `CAT` and its label lists, the `part`/`shell`/`surface`/`onSurf` wrappers and the per-frame animation
 *   helpers the sections share (no parts)
 * - airframe.ts — fuselage, spinner, wing, trailing-edge, stabilizer and fin shells
 * - surfaces.ts — flaps, ailerons, elevator and rudder, and the details on them (wicks, horn balances, hinges, trim tabs)
 * - cowl.ts — cowl openings: cooling inlets, NACA induction ducts, exit louvers, oil filler door
 * - gear.ts — main and nose gear, wheels, brakes, parking brake, rudder pedals / toe brakes
 * - engine.ts — propeller and engine: ignition, governor, oil, induction, exhaust, alternators, starter; the turbo, intercooler
 *   and heat-exchanger anchors
 * - engine-ignition.ts — engine ignition and starting
 * - engine-oil.ts — engine oil system
 * - engine-air.ts — engine induction and exhaust
 * - engine-sensors.ts — engine sensors, mount and baffles
 * - engine-baffles.ts — engine cooling baffles, their seals and the intercooler seals
 * - structure.ts — firewall, aft bulkhead, spar, roll cage, wing attach points
 * - cabin.ts — cockpit / cabin: panel, bolster switches, console, seats, side yokes and trim, flap drive and switch, fuel
 *   selector, CAPS handle, safety equipment
 * - cockpit.ts — centre panel and console controls
 * - electrical.ts — electrical hardware: MCU, batteries, ground power
 * - avionics.ts — avionics, antennas, magnetometer
 * - pitot.ts — pitot-static and stall warning
 * - fuel.ts — fuel system hardware
 * - environment.ts — environmental system
 * - aircon.ts — air conditioning hardware
 * - caps.ts — CAPS canister and harness
 * - lights.ts — interior and exterior lights
 * - controls.ts — flight-control mechanisms (POH Figures 7-1, 7-2, 7-3)
 * - controls-trim.ts — trim systems and servo linkages
 * - ice.ts — TKS ice protection hardware, present only with FIKI (AMM 30-00)
 * - oxygen.ts — built-in oxygen: bottle, regulator, supply line, overhead manifold and outlets, control panel, filler station
 * - electrical-harness.ts — electrical harness and circuit protection
 *
 * The sections are imported below in registration order. Part ids come from a running counter and the first part with a
 * given name gets the label pin, so keep this order, and never import a section from one that comes before it here.
 * Sections may import anchors only from earlier sections; outside consumers use ./parts.
 * Shared constants go in catalogue.ts.
