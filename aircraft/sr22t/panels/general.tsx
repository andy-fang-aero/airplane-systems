If one ADAHRS fails, the system switches to the functioning one (POH 3-43) and the PFD shows USING AHRS2 / USING ADC2 above the roll scale while it reads ADAHRS 2 (Perspective+ Pilot's Guide 190-02183-01 Fig 2-48). With one air data computer left, VDI NO COMP posts in the PFD's sensor comparison annunciation area in black text on a white background (POH 7-81), with the ALT, IAS, PIT, ROL and HDG no-compare boxes (Pilot's Guide Fig 2-47, Table 2-4); places on the PFD approximate. Only with both lost do the red X's appear (POH 3-43).",

        Unlock before opening; close before locking. Cabin and baggage keys interchange (POH 7-26, 7-31). Each cabin
        door has an exterior key lock; it cannot be locked from inside and does not hinder escape from within (AMM 52-10
        PDF 2006; Fig 52-10-5 PDF 2031). The baggage door on the modelled airplane has a piano hinge and lanyard,
        without a gas strut (AMM Fig 52-30-1 sheet 1, PDF 2055).

        The doors on the airplane will remain 1-3 inches open in flight if not latched. If this is discovered on takeoff
        roll, abort takeoff if practical. If already airborne do not allow efforts to close the door interfere with the
